<h2 style="color:#4CAF50;">Example 9: VR Controller Movement</h2>

<p>
In this example, you can move around and explore the scene using either your laptop or a VR headset.
</p>

<h3 style="color:#2196F3;">How it works</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Laptop/Desktop:</b> Look around with the mouse, move with the <b>W, A, S, D</b> keys.</li>
  <li><b>VR Headset:</b> Use the controllers:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Right controller:</b> Jump with the thumbstick, look in the direction you want to move and push forwards on the thumbstick.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color:#9C27B0;">Testing</h3>
<p>
1. Try it first on your laptop — walk around and look in all directions.  
2. If you have a VR headset, put it on and test the controllers.  
3. If you don’t have a headset, you can use the <b>WebXR Emulator</b> browser plugin to fake VR controllers.
