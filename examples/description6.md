<h2 style="color:#795548;">ðŸŒ³ Importing 3D Models</h2>
<p>Instead of primitive shapes, we can use <b>3D models</b>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The model is loaded into <code>&lt;a-assets&gt;</code> and referenced by <b>id</b>.</li>
  <li>Adjust <b>position</b> and <b>scale</b> to place the model correctly.</li>
  <li>Replace <code>tree.glb</code> with another example from the assets folder, such as <code>assets/Houses/House.glb</code></li>
  <li>Be careful with capital letters, some code interpreters are case sensitive, if you have errors that's a good place to start checking.</li>
</ul>
