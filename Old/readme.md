# Balcombe Grammar School - Student Projects

Welcome to the **Balcombe Grammar School Student Projects Repository**! This repository hosts a variety of student projects, primarily developed using HTML and the [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) framework. These projects showcase the creativity and skills of our students in creating interactive and immersive experiences viewable on the web, including virtual reality (VR) content.

## About This Repository

Each student’s project is stored in a separate folder within this repository, named after the student (e.g., `Daniel`, `Armin`, `Marc`, etc.). These folders contain all the files required for each project to run independently. Projects are accessible via a web browser and can be viewed in VR when compatible.

## Project Structure

- Each student’s project is organized in its own subfolder within the repository.
- Projects are developed primarily using **HTML** and **A-Frame**.
- Each project contains an `index.html` file, which serves as the main entry point for the project.
- Additional resources, such as 3D models, textures, and scripts, are stored in subdirectories within each student’s project folder.
