# A-Frame Template: Model Playground

## Getting Started
This is a VR-ready scene using A-Frame, with a few models already in place.

### Controls
- Use mouse or headset to look around
- Arrow keys / WASD to move

### Try This!
- Change the position of a model
- Change the rotation or scale
- Uncomment the forest model near the bottom of the scene
- Swap in a different GLB from the Assets folder

### Notes
- Keep models under 3MB for best performance in WebXR
- Use `scale="0.1 0.1 0.1"` or similar to shrink big models
